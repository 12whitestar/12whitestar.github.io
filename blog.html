	<p> welcome to my blog, this is my first post. I thought about setting this site up, partly to hold information for myself, partly to promote myself for after i have finished my studies, and partly just becuse i wanted to. Anyway, i will hopefully continue to post here somewhat intermitantly, when i find something interesting or fun to write about.
